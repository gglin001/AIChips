  Rain and Andes partnership RISC-V — Rain AI

```
Rain AI Licenses Andes AX45MPV and Taps Andes Custom Computing BU to Accelerate Its Launch of Groundbreaking Compute-In-Memory (CIM) Generative AI Solutions

However, CIM by itself cannot completely address the vast and growing number of machine learning operators. A RISC-V CPU is ideal for efficient programming and future-proofing of an CIM-based NPU.  The RISC-V architecture allows users to add custom instructions to encapsulate the CIM computing blocks, easing software development efforts.  Andes automates this instruction customization process with its automated COPILOT compiler.

Both companies can share that AX45MPV and Andes’ unique RISC-V instruction customization solution, ACE/COPILOT both play pivotal roles to complement Rain AI’s groundbreaking CIM hardware, compiler, and runtime software to deliver scalable ML solutions for a variety of deployment points. Rain AI will unveil its accelerator solution in early 2025.
